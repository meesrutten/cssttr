# CSS To The Rescue!

This project contains a display of some standard HTML components one may see on a lot of websites.
The idea of the project is to do as much as possible with CSS without touching preprocessors or JavaScript.

## Code Convention

When I code in CSS I prefer a strict code convention.

```
.#[ElementSelector {
    RESETS

    DISPLAY

    POSITIONING

    SIZE

    MARGIN/PADDING

    COLORS

    OTHER, z-index, transitions, etc.
}
```
